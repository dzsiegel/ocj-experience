        <p>Nearly the entirety of this project is derived from the oral histories of Japanese and Japanese Americans from California State University of Fullerton's Lawrence de Graaf Center for Oral and Public History. Using the accounts of their own lives, their community institutions, and their parents’ lives, I was able to create the maps in this project. Those narratives contain an inestimable amount of information about the Orange County Japanese and Japanese American community before and after World War 2, and significant descriptions of the lifeways that these people pursued. While this project foregrounds maps, much of the most interesting things in those oral histories simply cannot be construed in a map. So, I have sectioned the website into multiple pages with multiple themes and focal points. I have designed them in a way that I hope you will find them somewhat non-linear, finding new connections that are not apparent to me!</p> <br>
        
        <p>The experiences represented in this project are unique and I cannot say they are evenly representative of the Orange County Japanese experience in the first half of the 20th century. In fact, as you browse the website, you might notice that a significant number of those that appear on the map or are mentioned, were economically successful and/or impactful in the Orange County community—veritable <i>meibо̄ka</i> (local notable). For those Japanese that came to the U.S., or Americans of Japanese ancestry, there were multiple times when their lives could have broken away from Orange County, and therefore, their stories would not appear in the oral histories that make up the sources here. As traveling and migrant labor, you could have returned to Japan after making (and sending home) a respectable amount of money. As a <i>nisei</i> (second generation Japanese) born in the U.S., you could have been sent to Japan for education, but never returned to the U.S. As a so-called “enemy alien” at the beginning of World War 2, unwilling to swear allegiance to the U.S. despite the stripping of your civil rights, you could have been deported to Japan. Yet again, as an “enemy alien,” you could have volunteered for the military, fought, and died. </p> <br>
        
        <p>As a final note on the sources, there have been times where I corroborated information from the oral histories to make the maps more accurate and fuller for a single person’s life. For example, many of the young people attended Santa Ana High School while growing up in Orange County. Being unsure whether the Santa Ana High School that they referred to was the same as today, I referenced the Santa Ana High School website, where I found that the high school had existed since the end of the 19th century. I conducted similar ad-hoc research when necessary and possible.</p> <br>
